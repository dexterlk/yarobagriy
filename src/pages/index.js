      Ever since I stepped into my first job I knew I needed to find a way out.
      This led me on my entrepreneurial quest. This quest consists of building
      enough income producing assets to quit my full-time job. A few of those
      assets include SaaS projects, podcasts, newsletters, communities, real
      estate rentals, and a stock dividend portfolio.

      My non-work hobbies include triatholons, traveling, poker, and spending
      quality time with my family.
